    "\n",
    "This is an interesting domain: \n",
    "Firstly, there are many non-engineered features. If we include only equities, we already have over 10,000 equities globally. That makes for at least 10,000 potential non-engineered features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, there are many datapoints. High-frequency trading firms trade . Even access to daily trading information gives us 30 years * 365 days = over 10,000 datapoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also interesting because research in machine learning and statistics has affected how markets behave. There is no strategy or algorithm that will solve this problem or remain forever 'optimal' - if a profitable strategy is found, it may be copied by other people and so be priced in or it may be fought against or taken advantage of. This is more relevant to high-frequency trading than daily trading but nonetheless has an impact.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a regression problem (as opposed to a classification problem) because we are predicting daily Adjusted Close prices for a stock. These prices are continuous.\n",

    "- Training cost or time: it is not critical to keep this lower than 12 hours because we are predicting daily prices based on stats from prior days' trading. \n",

    "What are **Adjusted** figures?\n",
    "\n",
    "What is an 'Adjusted Closing Price'\n",
    "An adjusted closing price is a stock's closing price on any given day of trading that has been amended to include any distributions and corporate actions that occurred at any time prior to the next day's open. The adjusted closing price is often used when examining historical returns or performing a detailed analysis on historical returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "BREAKING DOWN 'Adjusted Closing Price'\n",
    "A stock's price is typically affected by supply and demand of market participants. However, there are some corporate actions that affect a stock's price, which needs to be adjusted in the event of these actions. The adjusted closing price is a useful tool when examining historical returns because it gives analysts an accurate representation of the firm's equity value beyond the simple market price. It accounts for all corporate actions such as stock splits, dividends/distributions and rights offerings. Investors should understand how corporate actions are accounted for in a stock's adjusted closing price.\n",
    "Adjusting Prices for Stock Splits\n",
    "A stock split is a corporate action that is usually done by companies to make their share prices more marketable. A stock split does not affect a company's total market capitalization, but it does affect the company's stock price. Consequently, a company undergoing a stock split must adjust its closing price to depict the effect of the corporate action.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a company's board of directors may decide to split the company's stock three-for-one. Therefore, the company's shares outstanding increase by a multiple of three, while its share price is divided by three. If a stock closed at $300 the day prior to its stock split, the closing price is adjusted to $100, or $300 divided by 3, per share to show the effect of the corporate action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusting for Dividends\n",
    "Common distributions that affect a stock's price include cash dividends and stock dividends. The difference between cash dividends and stock dividends is shareholders are entitled to a predetermined price per share and additional shares, respectively. For example, assume a company declared a $1 cash dividend and is trading at $51 per share on the ex-dividend date. On the ex-dividend date, the stock price is reduced by $1 and the adjusted closing price is $50.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusting for Rights Offerings\n",
    "A stock's adjusted closing price also reflects rights offerings that may occur. A rights offering is an issue of rights given to existing shareholders, which entitles the shareholders to subscribe to the rights issue in proportion to their shares. For example assume a company declares a rights offering, in which existing shareholders are entitled to one additional share for every two shares owned. Assume the stock is trading at $50 and existing shareholders are able to purchase additional shares at a subscription price of $45. On the ex-date, the adjusted closing price is calculated based on the adjusting factor and the closing price.\n",

    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "In this section, all of your preprocessing steps will need to be clearly documented, if any were necessary. From the previous section, any of the abnormalities or characteristics that you identified about the dataset will be addressed and corrected here. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _If the algorithms chosen require preprocessing steps like feature selection or feature transformations, have they been properly documented?_\n",
    "- _Based on the **Data Exploration** section, if there were abnormalities or characteristics that needed to be addressed, have they been properly corrected?_\n",
    "- _If no preprocessing is needed, has it been made clear why?_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "In this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented. It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Is it made clear how the algorithms and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data?_\n",
    "- _Were there any complications with the original metrics or techniques that required changing prior to acquiring a solution?_\n",

    "In this section, you will need to discuss the process of improvement you made upon the algorithms and techniques you used in your implementation. For example, adjusting parameters for certain models to acquire improved solutions would fall under the refinement category. Your initial and final solutions should be reported, as well as any significant intermediate results as necessary. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Has an initial solution been found and clearly reported?_\n",

    "### Model Evaluation and Validation\n",
    "In this section, the final model and any supporting qualities should be evaluated in detail. It should be clear how the final model was derived and why this model was chosen. In addition, some type of analysis should be used to validate the robustness of this model and its solution, such as manipulating the input data or environment to see how the model’s solution is affected (this is called sensitivity analysis). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Is the final model reasonable and aligning with solution expectations? Are the final parameters of the model appropriate?_\n",
    "- _Has the final model been tested with various inputs to evaluate whether the model generalizes well to unseen data?_\n",

    "In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that emphasizes an important quality about the project. It is much more free-form, but should reasonably support a significant result or characteristic about the problem that you want to discuss. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",

    "### Reflection\n",
    "In this section, you will summarize the entire end-to-end problem solution and discuss one or two particular aspects of the project you found interesting or difficult. You are expected to reflect on the project as a whole to show that you have a firm understanding of the entire process employed in your work. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Improvement\n",
    "In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?_\n",
    "- _Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?_\n",
