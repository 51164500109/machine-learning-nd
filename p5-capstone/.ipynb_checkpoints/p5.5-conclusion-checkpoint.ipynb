    "### Free-Form Visualization\n",
    "In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that emphasizes an important quality about the project. It is much more free-form, but should reasonably support a significant result or characteristic about the problem that you want to discuss. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Have you visualized a relevant or important quality about the problem, dataset, input data, or results?_\n",
    "- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_\n",
    "- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection\n",
    "In this section, you will summarize the entire end-to-end problem solution and discuss one or two particular aspects of the project you found interesting or difficult. You are expected to reflect on the project as a whole to show that you have a firm understanding of the entire process employed in your work. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Have you thoroughly summarized the entire process you used for this project?_\n",
    "- _Were there any interesting aspects of the project?_\n",
    "- _Were there any difficult aspects of the project?_\n",
    "- _Does the final model and solution fit your expectations for the problem, and should it be used in a general setting to solve these types of problems?_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvement\n",
    "In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?_\n",
    "- _Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?_\n",
    "- _If you used your final solution as the new benchmark, do you think an even better solution exists?_\n",

    "**Before submitting, ask yourself. . .**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does the project report youâ€™ve written follow a well-organized structure similar to that of the project template?\n",
    "- Is each section (particularly **Analysis** and **Methodology**) written in a clear, concise and specific fashion? Are there any ambiguous terms or phrases that need clarification?\n",
    "- Would the intended audience of your project be able to understand your analysis, methods, and results?\n",
    "- Have you properly proof-read your project report to assure there are minimal grammatical and spelling mistakes?\n",
    "- Are all the resources used for this project correctly cited and referenced?\n",
    "- Is the code that implements your solution easily readable and properly commented?\n",
    "- Does the code execute without error and produce results similar to those reported?\n"
