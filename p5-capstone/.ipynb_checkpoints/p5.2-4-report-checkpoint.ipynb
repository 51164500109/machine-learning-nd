    "\n",
    "I intend to use **linear regression**. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression is a way of modelling data by observing data and constructing an equation that minimises error. This regression is linear because the equation takes the form\n",
    "$$\\hat y = \\sum \\beta_i x_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y$ is what we want to predict (stock prices) and $x_i$s are features such as the date. The hat on top of $y$ indicates it is an estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, this regression is linear because the $x_i$s all have degree 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm Justification\n",
    "1. I am using a **linear algorithm** because the the **signal-to-noise ratio in trading is low** and more complicated models seem like they would overfit.\n",
    "2. A linear regression is appropriate because this is a **regression problem** - that is, the output are continuous. \n",
    "    - Note that *regression* in linear regression does not mean the same thing as *regression* in a regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm Parameters\n",
    "There are only four parameters for `LinearRegression`:\n",
    "- `fit_intercept` is set to True by default; setting it to false assumes the data is centered and will not produce better results.\n",
    "- `normalize` normalizes the regressors X before regression. It is set to `False` by default.\n",
    "- `copy_X` alters whether or not X may be overwritten, which does not affect the result.\n",
    "- `n_jobs` can provide a speedup if the problem is large and you ask the algorithm to use more CPUs, but it will not change error measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within these, there is only one parameter that it may be useful to adjust (`normalize`) to improve the error of the result.\n",

    "**Complications** There was also a discrepancy in the trading dates. We have data for BP and GAIA on every trading day from 1999-10-29 to 2014-10-02, but beyond that the data for GAIA is incomplete. There was no information on GAIA trading on the second, fourth or fifth of October 2014 (whereas there was for BP). Thus our dataset is pared down even further to a size of 3754 as opposed to 10010 for BP. This is a huge cut.\n",

    "## Initial implementation\n",
    "I initially implemented the Linear Regression algorithm with the following basic features:\n",
    "* Adjusted Close prices on each of the 7 days prior to the first prediction date\n",
    "* Max Adjusted High and Min Adjusted Low for that 7-day period prior to the first prediction date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process:\n",
    "1. Construct dataframe `X` containing initial features and dataframe `y` with 'Adjusted Close' prices.\n",
    "    - This required some setting up to extract the relevant features from the dataset and put them in an appropriately formatted dataframe. This is in the first half of `prepare_train_test()` function in part 2.1 of `III. Methodology - Code.ipynb`.\n",
    "    - The `y` target `nday_prices` had prices for the next `n` days.\n",
    "2. Split `X` and `y` into training and test datasets.\n",
    "    - I wrote my own function to do this (initially in `train_test_split_noshuffle` before I absorbed it into `prepare_train_test()`) instead of using sklearn's `train_test_split`. This was because sklearn's function automatically shuffles the data. Shuffling the data is okay and desired for situations in which data is not ordered, but is not okay for time-series data. \n",
    "    - If the data were shuffled, e.g. the adjusted close price for 1 Sept 2016 might be in the training set. We might then be asked to predict the adjusted close prices for the 7 days after 31 Aug 2016, which would include the price for 1 Sept 2016 which we'd have seen before. That's cheating.\n",
    "3. Train model on training data.\n",
    "    - Because there were multiple outputs to predict in `nday_prices` (the model had to forecast prices for each of the 7 trading days after the last date it was given), I wrapped `MultiOutputRegressor` from sklearn's `multioutput` module around my classifier.\n",
    "    - This is in the first half of the function `classify_and_metrics` in `2.2 Classifier` in `III. Methodology - Code.ipynb`.\n",
    "4. Ask model to predict prices on test features.\n",
    "5. Print metrics\n",
    "    - I included this in `classify_and_metrics()` using my helper functions `rmsp()` (root mean squared percentage error) and `print_metrics()`. See Section `2.2 Classifier` in `III. Methodology - Code.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Refactoring\n",
    "I refactored the code so that I could run a full (1) train-test split, (2) train classifier, (3) test classifier and print metrics cycle using only one line. To do this, I wrapped all the functions those processes with the `execute()` function.\n",
