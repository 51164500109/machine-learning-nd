# Reinforcement Learning
Teaching system to prioritise by giving it corresponding rewards and punishments

## Foci
1. How reinforcement learning fills in model-building phase of workflow
2. How to compare reinforcement learning models
3. How reinforcement learning differs in terms of the kinds of models it produces vs supervised or unsupervised learning.

## Lessons

    - Markov Decision Processes
    - Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)
2. Game Theory
