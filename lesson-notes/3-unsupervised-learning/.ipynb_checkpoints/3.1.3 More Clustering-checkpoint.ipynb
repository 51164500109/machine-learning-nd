    "(Hierarchical agglomorative clustering. SLIC HAC)\n",
    "- Consider each object a cluster (n o bjects)\n",
    "- Define intercluster distance as the distance between the closest two points in the two clusters\n",
    "- Merge two closest clusters\n",
    "- Repeat n-k times to make n clusters\n",
